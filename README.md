## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. Two machine learning models, Random Forest and Neural Networks, are implemented to solve the classification problem. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation were conducted systematically to achieve optimal performance.

## Code Structure
1. **Load and Import Libraries**  
   All necessary Python libraries are imported, including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

2. **Load the Dataset**  
   The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and preprocessing.

3. **Explore the Dataset**  
   - Display the first few rows using `.head()`.  
   - Check for missing values with `.isnull().sum()`.  
   - Analyze class imbalance using `.value_counts()` on the target variable.  
   - Use `.describe()` for statistical insights.  
   - Examine feature types with `.dtypes`.  

4. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Column-Specific Preprocessing:**  
     Detailed preprocessing for each column, including encoding categorical variables and handling missing data.  
   - **Encode Categorical Variables:**  
     Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical features.  
   - **Feature Engineering:**  
     - Feature Extraction using PCA.  
     - Feature Selection for dimensionality reduction.  
   - **Normalize/Scale Numerical Features:**  
     Scale features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.  
   - **Handle Class Imbalance:**  
     Apply oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) and undersampling techniques.  
   - **Split the Dataset:**  
     Split data into training and testing sets.

5. **Visualize the Data**  
   Create visualizations to explore feature relationships and distributions.

6. **Random Forest Model**  
   Implement a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

7. **Neural Network Model**  
   Build and train a Neural Network using TensorFlow or PyTorch, with hyperparameter optimization.

8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - **Random Forest Tuning:**  
     Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal parameters.  
   - **Neural Network Tuning:**  
     Optimize learning rate, batch size, and architecture.

9. **Model Evaluation**  
   - **Random Forest Model:**  
     - Classification report: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support.  
     - ROC curve analysis.  
     - Learning curves for overfitting/underfitting detection.  
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for training/testing error.  
     - Confusion matrix.  
     - Validation curve.  
   - **Neural Network Model:**  
     - Classification metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support.  
     - ROC curve analysis.  
     - Visualize training/validation loss and accuracy.  
     - Confusion matrix.

10. **Get Predictions**  
    Use trained models to make predictions on new data.
